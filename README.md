# fyp-resin-repo
The deployment repo for the rasberry pi camera

## Development
### Requirements
We format python code with the [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) format.
To install black run
```sh
pip install black
```
Or for python 3
```sh
pip3 install black
```
When developing, copy the files from `/githooks` to `/.git/hooks` to have black automatically format on commit.
